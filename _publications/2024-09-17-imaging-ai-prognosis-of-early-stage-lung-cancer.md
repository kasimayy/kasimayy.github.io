Accurate prediction of lung cancer recurrence risk is crucial for treatment decisions and follow-up, particularly for Stage I patients who are not eligible for (neo-)adjuvant therapy but approximately one-third still recur after surgical resection. We present a machine learning model that uses patient computed tomography (CT) images and clinical features to predict lung cancer recurrence.
