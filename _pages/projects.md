RecapBot
======
![image]({{ "/images/recapbot_logo.jpg" | relative-path }}){: .page_image_left} RecapBot was Cisco Spark API-based chat-room bot that would summarise 'on-topic' and 'off-topic' messages in a group chat, developed as part of a team at the TechCrunch Disrupt London Hackathon. I worked on the python script that preprocessed the chat messages and used them for training a Naive-Bayes classifier. I also wrote the python function that applied the classifier to the messages and modified their markdown based on how 'relevant' the message was. The bot won ‘Best use of Cisco Spark API’ at TechCrunch Disrupt London 2016.

I acted as CTO alongside a close friend and CEO Assel Kashkenbayeva as we developed the app and well as the business plan, pitching it as part of UCLe Ventures.
