I'm a Machine Learning PhD student at Imperial College London. My research topic is focused on creating a decision support system for radiologists that can facilitate the diagnostic process using machine learning without the need for labeled data. My aim is to use past radiological exams (in various modalities, including X-rays and MRI) and their corresponding reports (created by clinicians as part of the normal protocol within a hospital) and develop a learning framework that can learn the correspondence between the image regions and parts of the report. Such a learning framework would greatly expedite the diagnostic process for radiologists without the need for generating specific ground-truth labels for each imaging modality.

I have also been an active member of [Women in Computing](http://wic.doc.ic.ac.uk/) at Imperial for several years, first as President and now as Secretary. I am proud to be part of the collective of undergrads, PhDs and staff members at Imperial dedicated to tackling the gender imbalance in STEM and making the workplace more inclusive. My role as part of WiC has included organising talks with inspirational female industry and academic speakers, delivering workshops, promoting wellbeing through yoga and running events as part of International Women's Day.

In my spare time, I like to keep active by cycling, hiking and running. I also love to unwind with some yoga, drawing, painting and knitting.
